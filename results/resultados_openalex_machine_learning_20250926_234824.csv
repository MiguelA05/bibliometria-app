"Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning",,,"From the Publisher:
This book brings together - in an informal and tutorial fashion - the computer techniques, mathematical tools, and research results that will enable both students and practitioners to apply genetic algorithms to problems in many fields. 

Major concepts are illustrated with running examples, and major algorithms are illustrated by Pascal computer programs. No prior knowledge of GAs or genetics is assumed, and only a minimum of computer programming and mathematics background is required.",1989-10-01,https://doi.org/10.5860/choice.27-0936,https://openalex.org/W3023540311,https://doi.org/10.5860/choice.27-0936,https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.5860/choice.27-0936,1989,article,en,False,,closed,Choice Reviews Online,journal,,50036,Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Quality control and genetic algorithms; Algorithm; Genetic algorithm; Meta-optimization,
C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning,J. R. Quinlan,"The University of Sydney, AU","From the Publisher:
Classifier systems play a major role in machine learning and knowledge-based systems, and Ross Quinlan's work on ID3 and C4.5 is widely acknowledged to have made some of the most significant contributions to their development. This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette for a Sun workstation.

C4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies.

This book and software should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses.",1992-10-15,https://cds.cern.ch/record/2031749,https://openalex.org/W2125055259,,,1992,book,en,False,,closed,,,,24194,Computer science; Unix; Classifier (UML); Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Source code; Workstation; Software; Decision tree; Sample (material); Software engineering; Data mining; Programming language; Operating system; Chemistry; Chromatography,
Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning,Carl Edward Rasmussen; Christopher K. I. Williams,,"A comprehensive and self-contained introduction to Gaussian processes, which provide a principled, practical, probabilistic approach to learning in kernel machines. Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a principled, practical, probabilistic approach to learning in kernel machines. GPs have received increased attention in the machine-learning community over the past decade, and this book provides a long-needed systematic and unified treatment of theoretical and practical aspects of GPs in machine learning. The treatment is comprehensive and self-contained, targeted at researchers and students in machine learning and applied statistics. The book deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression and classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.",2005-11-23,http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/pdf/Ras04.pdf,https://openalex.org/W4211049957,https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/3206.001.0001,https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/3206.001.0001,2005,book,en,False,http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/pdf/Ras04.pdf,closed,,,,18892,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Machine learning; Gaussian process; Gaussian; Chemistry; Computational chemistry,
